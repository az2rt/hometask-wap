# hometask-wap
Installation:
I use the following setup:
- macOS Sequoia 15.0.1
- python 3.9.6

This script should work on other platforms as well, as Python has built-in cross-platform support. However, I can't verify this.

Before run make next commands:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run test:
```bash
python -m pytest -s
```

After that you can see 'test.png' file in root directory of project.
